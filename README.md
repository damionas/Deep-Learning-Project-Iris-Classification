Prepare Input Data for Deep Learning

  the following steps was performed to prepare the data

  Load data into a pandas dataframe
  
  
  Convert the dataframe to a numpy array
  
  
  Scale the feature dataset
  
  
  Use one-hot-encoding for the target variable
  
  
  Split into training and test datasets
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Creating a Model
The model on Keras was created using the following model

Number of hidden layers

Number of nodes in each layer

Activation functions

Loss Function & Accuracy measurements
